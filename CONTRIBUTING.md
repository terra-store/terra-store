# Contributing to Terra-Store

We love your input! We want to make contributing to this project as easy and transparent as possible, whether it's:

- Reporting a bug
- Discussing the current state of the code
- Submitting a fix
- Proposing new features
- Becoming a maintainer

## We Develop with Github

We use github to host code, to track issues and feature requests, as well as accept pull requests.

## We Use [Github Flow](https://guides.github.com/introduction/flow/index.html), So All Code Changes Happen Through Pull Requests

Pull requests are the best way to propose changes to the codebase (we use [Github Flow](https://guides.github.com/introduction/flow/index.html)). We actively welcome your pull requests:

1. Fork the repo and create your branch from `main`.
1. If you've added code that should be tested, add tests.
1. If you've changed APIs, update the documentation.
1. Ensure the test suite passes.
1. Make sure your code lints.
1. Issue that pull request!

## Any contributions you make will be under the Apache 2.0 Software License

In short, when you submit code changes, your submissions are understood to be under the same [Apache 2.0 License](https://choosealicense.com/licenses/apache-2.0/) that covers the project. Feel free to contact the maintainers if that's a concern.

## Report bugs using Github's [issues](https://github.com/terra-store/terra-store/issues)

We use GitHub issues to track public bugs. Report a bug by [opening a new issue](https://github.com/terra-store/terra-store/issues/new/choose); it's that easy!

## Write bug reports with detail, background, and sample code

**Great Bug Reports** tend to have:

- A quick summary and/or background
- Steps to reproduce
  - Be specific!
  - Give sample code if you can.
- What you expected would happen
- What actually happens
- Notes (possibly including why you think this might be happening, or stuff you tried that didn't work)

People *love* thorough bug reports. I'm not even kidding.

## Use a Consistent Coding Style

This project is tested against the [PEP-8](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/) and [PEP-257](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0257/) python coding standards amongst others.  [Codacy](https://app.codacy.com/gh/terra-store/terra-store/dashboard?branch=main) is used at Pull Request to ensure that issues in code are resolved prior to merge.

To make this easier the following steps will help:

- Use 4 spaces for indentation rather than tabs
- Run `make link` to check your code against the style rules before pushing
